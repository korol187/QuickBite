## 1. Introduction & Purpose
This document outlines the vision, scope, and stakeholder needs for "QuickBite," a modern, microservices-based food delivery application. The primary purpose of this project is to serve as a practical demonstration of advanced software engineering principles, including distributed systems architecture, modern CI/CD practices, and robust requirements definition.

## 2. Business & Project Objectives
- **Business Objective:** To create a platform that seamlessly connects users with local restaurants, enabling them to discover, order, and receive food efficiently.
- **Project Objective:** To build a scalable, maintainable, and resilient system using a JavaScript-based microservices architecture. This project will serve as a portfolio piece to demonstrate proficiency in advanced software engineering principles.

## 3. Stakeholder Analysis
We have identified two primary stakeholder groups whose needs will drive the project's features.
